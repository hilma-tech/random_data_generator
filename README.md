# Random Data Generator

Create a csv file in the format:

table | column | date_type | unique | content 
----- | ------ | --------- | ------ | ------- 
*table name* | *column name* | *int, string, timestamp or input* | *running, yes, no* | *range, name, list, uuid, timestamp, date*
*table name* | *column name* | *int, string, timestamp or input* | *running, yes, no* | *range, name, list, uuid, timestamp, date*

Make as many columns as you need and write as many tables as you need

Once the csv is created put the exact file location into the config file and then run the program and check the working directory for the newly created csv file which is called {table name}.csv
